So you can make a call to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given postal code and the result would be None, and then make the call again and you would get the coordinates. So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code.\n\nGiven that this package can be very unreliable, in case you are not able to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using the Geocoder package, here is a link to a csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n\nUse the Geocoder package or the csv file to create a  dataframe.\n\nImportant Note: There is a limit on how many times you can call geocoder.google function. It is 2500 times per day. This should be way more than enough for you to get acquainted with the package and to use it to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods in the Toronto.\n\nOnce you are able to create the dataframe, submit a link to the new Notebook on your Github repository."
